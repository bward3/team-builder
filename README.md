# Team Builder

## Description

This application uses the Inquirer npm package to take user input from the command line and generate an HTML document displaying information about members of a project team. The application prompts the user for contact information and other pertinent details about the project team members. Once information is gathered, it is injected into an HTML page with simple Bootstrap stylings to generate a simple but stylish project homepage.
